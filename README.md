First the program ask you to type 3 number input. The first if and else are to check wheck whether first number or second number is higher. And inside those if and else there are another if and else to check whether the first/second or the third is higher. If the first/second is higher that mean first/second is highest depend on the first if and else whether 1 or 2 are higher. If the third higher this mean that third one is highest.
